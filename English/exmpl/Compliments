Compliments

A: Mr. Kerswell, your presentation was fantastic. So informative and easy to understand!

B: Thank you! I am glad you like it! And if you have questions, please feel free to ask.

A: Thank you. I was interested by your innovation in drone`s motors size and weight. Your research gives us THE opportunity to have more light motors and as the result - lighter drones! But does your prototype provide the same stability for drone at windy weather?

B: First of all, it is not recommended to fly in bed weather with any type of consumer drones! But you ask A really nice question! Currently we ARE working on increasing the power of our new motors but for now they are less powerful than general brushless analogues.

A: So what is an advantage of it? In case that this motors make drone less stable!

B: As you know, there are a lot of governor laws which limit THE usage of drones above 250 grams. Lighter motors make THE possibility to produce more light drones, even under 250 gram in total! We want to give drones companies THE opportunity to manufacture highly featured cinematic drones which everyone can buy and use without any problems with THE law!

A: Oh, I see now! It is really make a lot of sense! Thank you for this conversation and for THE presentation! You do a really great job!

B: Thank you for being interested in our invention!
