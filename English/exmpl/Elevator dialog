A: ...

B: ... Artem.

A: Giovanny. Not the best way to make friends, I should say.

B: Hah, that`s true! But you got ready to this, as I see.

A: What do you mean? Oh, my backpack. Yeh, at least we have THE opportunity to survive a couple of days if this emergency service continueS working so slowly. Is this a usual situation at your house?

B: Hope we will be free much earlier! I have been living at this house for 15 years. And this is the first time I have troubles with THE elevator.

B: Where ARE you from?

A: Napoli, Italy. Have you been there?

A: Wow, this is fantastic!!! I am so glad to heare that you like my native town! But what are you? If it`s not a secret! it`s a big advantage to have an opportunity to work from any place, I should say!

A: Hah, I am always wondering such people, nice job! Never understand that under the hood dark magic of digitality! I prefer something more real and tangible. Engines and mechanisms - this is my passion. I am a car mechanic. All neighbors know who can help if their "little baby" start sneezing.

B: Hah, I am totally understand you! My neighbours always come to me with broken phones and laptops. Sometimes I even think of moving out to some safer place.

A: Sorry, hold on a second. It seems that in a second we will be free!!!

B: Oh, finally! I don`t want to spend an eternity here! But we deffenetly should meet again in more enjoyable situation. Please, feel free to come and see me in the evening! My flat is 43. It`s on 5-th floor.

A: That`s very kind of you! I`d love to come!
